# Traveler Backend
A travel planner app

This is the backend code for the app. It is written in Ruby using Ruby on Rails. Users can plan/add trips. After they add a trip they
will be able to search the area they are travelling to for bars, restaurants, museums, landmarks, or parks using calls to Yelp's api.
The user can click on events from the search to add to their itinerary.
